## Project Title:
Student Counseling Slot Booking System

## Project Description:
The Student Counseling Slot Booking System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of booking and managing counseling sessions for students and counselors. It allows students to view available time slots, book appointments, and receive email reminders about their scheduled sessions. Counselors can manage their availability, confirm appointments, and also receive reminders for their upcoming counseling sessions.

This system ensures that both students and counselors have an organized, efficient, and user-friendly way to manage counseling appointments, reducing scheduling conflicts and improving overall productivity.

## Features:
- **Student Booking System**: Students can search and book available counseling slots based on their preferred time and date.
- **Counselor Availability Management**: Counselors can set their available time slots, which will be visible to students for booking.
- **Automatic Email Notifications**: Students and counselors receive confirmation and reminder emails for appointments.
- **Alternative Slot Suggestions**: If the selected slot is unavailable, the system will provide alternative available slots for students.
- **Admin Interface**: Administrators can monitor and manage the entire booking process.
